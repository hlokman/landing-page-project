# landing-page-project

Project: Landing Page is a part of TOP curriculum. The goal is to create a webpage from scratch and style it using HTML and CSS. 

This project allowed me to improve the basics of HTML (like the Boilerplate) but most importantly to organize all the .html file using coherent divs in order to fit each "section" of the webpage.

Then I used the CSS knowledge I learned from TOP curriculum so far (using Flexbox) to style and place all the elements as desired within the webpage. It includes a lot of proprieties:
- Changing fonts, colors, background-colors, styles...
- Resizing elements and make them fit as wished
- Flex shorthand
- Changing the axes to arrange the content
- etc.

I made a good use of the different types of situations encountered in the css-exercises (within the CSS exercises repository of TOP on Github) that I've done so far.

This project allowed me to deeply develop my skills and to get me used to set up a full webpage from scratch, step by step. I had to go back and forth within the .html and .css codes and test several proprieties to get to the desired outcome.
